  ## Description

  Every project should have a corresponding README file providing information about it. 
  
  This application aims to accomplish that goal by dynamically generating a README.md file based on the answers entered by the user in the command-line. This allows the project creator to devote more time working on the project. 
  
  By default, the README file generated will include the projectâ€™s description, installation, usage, license, contribution, testing and questions.
